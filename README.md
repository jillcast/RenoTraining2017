# RenoTraining2017
2017 Data Training in Reno, Nevada for the USA TODAY Network


Session 1: Using data to tell stories (1 hour, Jill Castellano and Brian Duggan)
This session is an overview of data journalism – what it is, what different software tools can help you do, why data journalism matters and great examples of easy and not-so-easy data journalism projects.
 
Session 2: Quick turnaround data stories (45 minutes, Jill Castellano and maybe Brian Duggan)
We’ll talk about tried and true datasets that are sure to lead to story ideas in your newsroom that can be turned around quickly. For example, you’ll learn how to check for dangerous bridges in your area and see how other papers have reported their own stories from the same dataset.
 
Session 3: Crash course in Excel (1 hour and 15 minutes, Jill Castellano)
This Excel crash course will begin with the basics, like taking averages and medians, and graduate to more advanced concepts like pivot tables, and if there’s time, VLookups. Along the way, you’ll learn many new formulas that will save you loads of time when looking at your datasets.
REQUIRED: Must bring computer with Excel installed
 
Session 4: Other tips and tricks about data and public records (1 hour, Jill Castellano)
Learn how to file the best records request possible, how to get your data into the right format (those darn PDFs!) and how to do some basic web scraping using Google sheets.
 
Session 5: Introduction to MySQL (1 hour and 30 minutes, Jill Castellano) -- ADVANCED
In this session designed for people who want to go beyond Excel, you’ll learn how to use MySQL for analyzing large datasets. You’ll be amazed by how much faster this tool is at analyzing data and what the possibilities are. This session will assume no prior experience with MySQL but should only be attended by people who are already proficient in Excel.   
REQUIRED: Must bring computer with MySQL Workbench installed (talk to your local IT administrator to have this completed by Tuesday)
 
Session 6: Data cleaning with OpenRefine (45 minutes, Jill Castellano) – ADVANCED
Tired of seeing “Nevada” spelled 50 different ways in your dataset? OpenRefine is a great, free program that can clean up really messy data so you can get to the bottom of what’s going on in your communities. This session will assume no prior experience but will be more helpful for people who tend to work with messy or large datasets.
